# National Animals Data Visualisation

## Introduction

The Main Objective of this project was to take unstructured data in the form of an HTML page, in this case a Wikipedia page found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_animals) and display the data in an interactive way.

It involved scraping, parsing, storing, sending and displaying data in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format.

There are ofcousre more efficient and better ways to obtain data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=parse&page=Flag_of_Ireland&format=json).

However that was not the purpose of the project.
